# lacework\_integration\_gcp\_at

Use this resource to configure a GCP Audit Trail integration to analyze Audit Trail
activity for monitoring cloud account security.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "lacework_integration_gcp_at" "account_abc" {
  name         = "account ABC"
  resource_id  = "ABC-project-id"
  subscription = "projects/example-project-id/subscriptions/example-subscription"
  credentials {
    client_id      = "123456789012345678900"
    client_email   = "email@abc-project-name.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    private_key_id = "1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd"
    private_key    = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n ... -----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
  }
}
```

## GCP Audit Trail Module Usage

Lacework maintains a Terraform module that can be used to create and manage the necessary
resources required for both, the cloud provider platform as well as the Lacework platform.

Here is a basic usage of this module:

```hcl
module "config" {
  source  = "lacework/audit-log/gcp"
  version = "~> 0.1.1"
}
```

To see the list of inputs, outputs and dependencies, visit the [Terraform registry page of this module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/lacework/audit-log/gcp/latest).
